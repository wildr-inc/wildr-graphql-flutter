# Contributing to GraphQL-Flutter

We would love for you to contribute to graphql-flutter and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [Question or Problem?](#question)
- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
- [Feature Requests](#feature)
- [Submission Guidelines](#submit)
- [Coding Rules](#rules)
- [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] where the questions should be tagged with tags `flutter` and `graphql`.

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow
- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.

If you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via [our discord channel][discord].

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
  discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
  and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs, we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction. Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

We will be insisting on a minimal reproduction scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal reproduction. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue templates](https://github.com/zino-app/graphql-flutter/issues/new/choose) and filling out the issue template.

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/zino-app/graphql-flutter/pulls) for an open or closed PR
   that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
   Discussing the design up front helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.
3. Fork the `zino-app/graphql-flutter` repo.
4. Make your changes in a new git branch:

    - For fixes bug fixes:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
   ```

    - For new features:
    
     ```shell
    git checkout -b my-fix-branch beta
    ```

5. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
6. Add and Update the documentation for your feature.
7. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
   [commit message conventions](#commit). Adherence to these conventions
   is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

   ```shell
   git commit -S -a
   ```

   **Note:** the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files. While the options `-S` ensures are your commits are signed.

8. Make sure all of your commits are signed - follow instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-commits) to learn how to sign your commits.
9. Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

10. In GitHub, send a pull request to `graphql-flutter:master` for fixes and `graphql-flutter:beta` for new features.

- If we suggest changes then:

  - Make the required updates.
  - Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

- Check out the master branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout master -f
  ```

- Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

- Update your master with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream master
  ```

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules

see `doc/dev/MANTAINERS.md` file


## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
we use the git commit messages trigger releases.
